Object Encoding

As outlined in the value types specification, objects are opened and
closed by corresponding curly braces ({}). The names of properties of
objects require no prefix, escaping, or quoting if the entire name
consists of standard UTF-8 alphanumeric characters. If non-alphanumeric
characters are present, then the name must be contained within double
quotes. Like strings, double quotes within the name must be escapted
with a backslash (\).

{"first": 1}: {first +1}
{"first second": 12}: {"first second" +12}
{"first \"half\" second": 1122}: {"first \"half\" second" +1122}

Properties of an object may be separated by any form or quantity or
whitespace, a comma, or a combination of both.

{"first": 1, "second": "two"}:
	{first +1,second :two}
	{first +1 second :two}
	{first +1 , second :two}
